I wrote this program to translate 8,000+ Anki simplified Chinese
sentences to traditional ones using the Google Translate API.

It cost me about one dollar to translate approximately 100,000 characters.

I've found that the Google Translate API is accurate for Chinese Simplified <-> Traditional, so I hope there aren't any systemic problems.

You can find my enhanced version, with fields for both simplified and traditional characters, here: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/127562610.

You can find the original deck here; many thanks to the original compiler: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2003820603.
